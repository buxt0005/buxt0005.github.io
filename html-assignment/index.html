            <p> My name is Zee/Raven Cain and I use <q>he/him</q> and <q>they/them</q> pronouns.
                Whilst it <br> may not be my legal name, it is the name that I use for outside purposes and <br>
                therefore introduce myself as such. I do <em>not</em> appreciate being called <br> by <q>she/her</q>
                pronouns, nor my deadname.
                My ethnicity is Korean, however I was raised here in Canada and I consider this <br> to be my home
                country. </p>

            <p> I have <em>a lot</em> varied interests and passions such as witchcraft, music and coding. I love to take
                on
                all sorts of new projects as I find it to be <br> fun to expand my horizons. However, I tend to take to
                finding
                new ways to explore creative outlets. For example, recently I've been trying <br> to make t-shirt
                designs and write some
                songs. Other ways include playing instruments, taking pictures and drawing. Witchcraft is a part of <br>
                my religion as I'm
                Wiccan. It is also a big part of my day to day life.</p>
