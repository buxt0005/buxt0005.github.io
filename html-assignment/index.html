        <p> My name is Zee/Raven Cain and I use he/him and they/them pronouns. Whilst it may not be my legal name, it is the
            name that I use for outside purposes and therefore introduce myself as such. I use he/they pronouns and I'm a
            non-binary person. I don't appreciate being called by she/her pronouns, nor my deadname.</p>
    
        <p> I have a lot of interests and passions such as witchcraft, music and photography. I love to take on all sorts of
            new projects as I find it to be fun to expand my horizons. I tend to take to finding new ways to explore
            creative outlets. For example, recently I've been trying to make t-shirt designs and write some songs. </p>
