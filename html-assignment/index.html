    </center>

    <p> My name is Zee/Raven Cain and I use <q> he/him</q> and <q>they/them</q> pronouns. Whilst it may not be my legal
        name, it is the
        name that I use for outside purposes and therefore introduce myself as such. I use <q>he/they</q> pronouns and
        I'm a non-binary person. I do <em>not</em> appreciate being called by <q>she/her</q> pronouns, nor my deadname.
        My
        ethnicity is Korean, however I was raised here in Canada and I consider this my home country. </p>

    <p> I have <em> a lot </em> varied interests and passions such as witchcraft, music and coding. I love to take on
        all sorts of new projects as I find it to be fun to expand my horizons. However, I tend to take to finding new
        ways to
        explore creative outlets. For example, recently I've been trying to make t-shirt designs and write some songs.
        Other
        ways include playing instruments, taking pictures and drawing. Witchcraft is a part of my religion as I'm
        Wiccan.</p>
