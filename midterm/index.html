        <div id="backstory">
            <p> My Chemical Romance is an American band that formed September 12 of 2001. They formed the day after lead
                singer, Gerard Way witnessed the atrocity that occured on September 11, 2001 in New York City. They
                originate from New Jersey as this is where all the members come from. The consistent members throughout
                the years are Gerard Way, Mikey Way, Frank Iero and Ray Toro. Ray and Frank are the guitarists of the
                band whilst Mikey plays bass and Gerard is on vocals. Over the years, they've had to switch drummers as
                there were issues between them and the drummers. An example is when one of the drummers, Michael
                Pedicone stole merchandise to sell on the side. The other members weren't happy with this and they
                kicked him out of the band. March 22 2013, the mental health of the group was suffering terribly so they
                broke up. Recently on October 31 2019, the band got back together and played a reunion show December 20,
                2019.</p>
