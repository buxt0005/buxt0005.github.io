            <h1> My Chemical Romance's History</h1>
            <article> My Chemical Romance is an American band that formed September 12 of 2001. They formed the day
                after lead
                singer, Gerard Way witnessed the atrocity that occured on September 11, 2001 in New York City. They
                originate from New Jersey as this is where all the members come from. The consistent members throughout
                the years are Gerard Way, Mikey Way, Frank Iero and Ray Toro. Ray and Frank are the guitarists of the
                band whilst Mikey plays bass and Gerard is on vocals. Over the years, they've had to switch drummers as
                there were issues between them and the drummers. An example is when one of the drummers, Michael
                Pedicone stole merchandise to sell on the side. The other members weren't happy with this and they
                kicked him out of the band. March 22 2013, the mental health of the group was suffering terribly so they
                broke up. Recently on October 31 2019, the band got back together and played a reunion show December 20,
                2019.</article>

            <h1> Band Members</h1>

            <article> Frank Iero is a guitarist from New Jersey. Over the years, one thing that has been known about
                Frank is his extreme theatrics on stage. From causing injuries of other bandmates to rolling around on
                the floor, Frank is known for being the personification of chaos. Deep down, past his chaotic side, he
                has a sweet and loving side that comes out behind the scenes. During the time of the breakup, Frank
                continued music with other bands like Frank Iero and the Future Violents. <br> <br>

                Mikey and Gerard Way are brothers with Mikey being the younger of the two. Mikey is the bassist and
                Gerard is the vocalist. Mikey tends not to do much on stage during the performance, Gerard on the other
                hand is a lot like Frank in the sense that he will put on a show for his fans. Post-breakup, Gerard
                decided to continue on with his passion of comic book writing, whilst Mikey went on to talk about mental
                health.

                Ray Toro is the final main member of the band and he's the other guitarist alongside Frank. Unlike
                Frank, he's not as crazy on stage. After the breakup, he went solo with his music for a bit and then
                went off the grid.
